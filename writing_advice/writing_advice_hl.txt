High Level is the hardest regular Soft Skills research level. For this level, you have to build tables and find links to answer questions. Repeated steps are only written out once. Do not use information directly from Generative AI (Copilot Answer, ChatGPT, Google Gemini). Make sure to use information from a website and include the link to that website. Do not copy and paste information. Rewrite information in your own words.
