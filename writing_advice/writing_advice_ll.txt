Low Level is an easier Soft Skills research level. For this level, you are given tables. You have to find links to answer questions. Repeated steps are written out. Avoid using information directly from Generative AI (Copilot Answer, ChatGPT, Google Gemini). Make sure to use information from a website and include the link to that website. Try to avoid copying and pasting too much information. Only use necessary information from websites.
