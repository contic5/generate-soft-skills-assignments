Medium Level is the average Soft Skills research level. For this level, you have to build tables and find links to answer questions. Repeated steps are only written out once.  Avoid using information directly from Generative AI (Copilot Answer, ChatGPT, Google Gemini). Make sure to use information from a website and include the link to that website. Avoid copying and pasting information. Try to rewrite information in your own words.
