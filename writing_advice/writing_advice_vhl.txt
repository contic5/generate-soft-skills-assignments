Very High Level is a special Soft Skills research level. This is significantly harder than other levels. For this level, you have to determine what questions you want to answer. Choose interesting questions that will help your audience understand your topic. Do not copy and paste information.  Do not use information directly from Generative AI (Copilot Answer, ChatGPT, Google Gemini). Make sure to use information from a website and include the link to that website. Rewrite information in your own words. Make sure your answers are interesting and are more than just lists or walls of text. You are trying to teach high school students about a soft skill, so make sure your resources are appropriately complex for high schoolers. You want to make a clear and concise presentation. Good luck.
